# Moved #

The [source](http://code.google.com/p/trillian-bdc/source/checkout) of this plugin was moved from a private [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) repository. It predominantly represents the changes that were made in anticipation of open sourcing this plugin.

This Subversion repository was reorganized in 2006. Changes prior to that reorganization are not included, but they aren't too fascinating anyway.

Subversion was first used earlier in 2006. Hence the original inception and the initial work done is not caught in any source code management system.
