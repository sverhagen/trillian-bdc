Here are some frequently-asked questions

**Question**: Why am I seeing a very old age displayed for an entry, e.g.: `2013y John`?

**Answer**: The year of birth is probably not filled out. The entry is thus assumed born in the year 0, and is thus now assumed 2013 years old (or whatever year it is when you're reading this answer)

**Question**: Why do I keep getting popups saying: "`File could not be opened: `_..._`\birthdays.xml`", or: "`File could not be written`"?

**Answer**: There are reports of this happening for users with uncommon characters in the name of their Trillian profile (let's say "non-Western characters"); try changing that. Of course the particular file location should be writable, but that's not typically a problem with the Trillian profile folder

**Question**: Can I backup the data of this plugin?

**Answer**: Yes, look for `birthdays.xml` in your Trillian profile folder and store a copy of it, that's all. You may find your profile folder here: `C:\Users\`_<user name>_`\AppData\Roaming\Trillian\users\`_<profile name>_`\`. However, you may have overridden this file location
