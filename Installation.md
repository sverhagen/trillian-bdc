# Installation #

  1. Make sure you have Trillian installed and working
  1. Download a [plugin archive](https://code.google.com/p/trillian-bdc/downloads/list)
  1. Unpack the plugin archive to your Trillian's `plugins` folder, i.e.: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Trillian\plugins`. In other words: copy `BDC.dll` to that folder
  1. Start (or restart) Trillian
  1. Go to Trillian Preferences, then "Plugins", find "BDC.dll" in your list of installed plugins, activate it by checking the box in front
  1. You may configure your further plugin [preferences](Preferences.md)

As a result you should see the "Birthdays" section in Trillian.

This is not meant as an exhaustive tutorial on plugin installation, but it's generally not difficult to do so!
