Right-click on the Known Birthdays group and Add your own friends's birthdays, or right-click on an existing birthday and Edit it.

When entering or editing a birthday, you can enter your friends's name and his or her day, month and year of birth.

You will be alerted of your friends's birthday a number of days in advance. This number can be set in the plugin's Preferences.

Depending on the corresponding Preferences setting, you will be reminded daily; either until the actual birthday or until you confirm the birthday. Confirmation being required, depends on the plugin's Preferences.

A birthday will be shown at the top of the Birthdays section until the actual birthday or until confirmed, whichever occurs later.

When a (daily) alert is required, this will occur at midnight or the first time after midnight that the plugin is started by Trillian.
An alert normally is done through a Trillian tray alert. However, when Warn annoyingly is selected in the plugin's Preferences, a foreground dialog box with accompanying sound will be used to alert you.

To confirm or remove a birthday, right-click on it and choose the appropriate option.

You can easily import ICQ contacts through the Preferences of the plugin. Note that this process can take a bit since for every contact a slow connection to the ICQ web site has to be made.

You can easily import vCard files (vcf) through the Preferences of the plugin. vCard files can be exported from for instance Windows Address Book.

You can easily import birthdays from the default Windows Address Book (WAB) through the Preferences of the plugin.

ICQ, vCard and WAB imported birthdays are indicated as such by a right-hand icon. This indication can be switched off through the Preferences.
